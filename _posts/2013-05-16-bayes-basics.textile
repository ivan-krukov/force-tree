These are my notes on Bayesian inference from "Barry G. Hall's":1 book.

h3. General

Baeyesian methods attempt to build the best tree based on both the _data_ and the given _model_ @max(P(tree|data,model))@, while ML only maximizes based on the data @max(P(data|tree))@. The algorithm is essentially an optimizer of the tree space - it attempts to find the maiximum height point. The height of a particular tree in the tree space corresponds to the likelihood of that tree. The closeness of the points in space corresponds to their similarity.

Unlike ML, where we are looking for a single best tree, BI searches for a set of trees. 

A BI program will proceed in the following steps until _convergence_:

# Chose some tree as a starting point
# Determine the tree's likelihood
# Change the tree slightly by topology or branch length
# Calculate the likelihood of the new tree
# Accept the new tree if its likelihood is greater than that of the previous tree.

One can clearly see the analogy with optimization algorithms such as gradient descent.

Bayesian analysis depnds strongly on the model that has been selected, which is why it is essential to chose the appropriate model (I feel like I am being a bit too obvious here).
